# Renewable Energy Efficiency Prediction
This project predicts energy efficiency using weather and energy data. The goal is to identify key factors influencing efficiency and build a predictive model.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Trends by season, energy source, and region.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, with hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
- Best Model: Random Forest
- Test RÂ²: 0.492
- Test MSE: 0.00016

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-link>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `modeling.py` to train and test the model.
